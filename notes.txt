HOW DOES THE ALGORITHM WORK
we have a black image
and we have an input image

the algorithm will copy the black image and randomly place 
an object in it(object will have random rot, pos, color and size)

then the algorithm will give points based on generated image

repeat for 1000 objects

the 100 of them with the highest score will live, make variations
repeat

after x amount of runs, a cool image will appear

2.147.483.647 i32 limit (for score value)


TODO: 
* Add compare2images func:           DONE
* Add multiply blending with alpha   DONE
* Add Sprite folder with sprites:    DONE
* test if calculating score works    DONE
* GOTO LINE 396 and change the x and y posiiton from 0,0 to the center of the screen
* Make the evolution thingy:
* TADA!!! 



BUG SOLVING NOTES
* OBJECTLISTS ARENT ACTUALLY BEING RESETTED
* FIXED: choosing highest scoring algorithm
